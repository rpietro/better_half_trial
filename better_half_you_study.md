# Talking to better half of you - A study to understand how to improve work engagement, meaning, purpose in life, job satisfaction in the workplace

## Our objective

The aim of our study is to investigate whether an online course, provided for free for your employees, can improve their overall work engagement, their job satisfaction in the workplace, feeling that there is an underlying meaning in their work as well as that their life if fullfiling a greater purpose. This course will require that they watch one video and do a few exercises every week, all of this not taking more than 1 hour/week for four weeks, which they can do outside of work. The course is entirely accessed from the Web using a regular browser and does not require the installation of any software.

This course is part of the research conducted by Dr. Francesco de Paola for his PhD at the Universit√† Basilicata.
